Reconstruction for 3 CVs in a 4D space and visualize as a Gaussian cube file. 
An example VMD script is provided to view the cube file, including some of the 
analysis done on this example free energy surface.

                           A snapshot from VMD is in snap.tga
Run VMD in command line as
vmd -e vreco.vmd
