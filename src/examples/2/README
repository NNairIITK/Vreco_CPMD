Reconstruction for 2CVs in a 3D space and view in OpenDX. 
PRINT NOGRID is used for this purpose. 

Vreco_CPMD.f90 input file: vreco.inp
Vreco_CPMD.f90 output    : vreco.out
OPENDX script            : vreco.net and vreco.general

Using OPENDX:
------------------

run in command line by 

dx -program vreco.net

Go to "Execute" -> "Execute Once" to visualize the free energy surface.
Image can be saved as "File" -> "Save As" in the Image window.
Choose resolution and format as you prefer. A sample image vreco.tiff 
in low resolution is also present in this directory. 

Edit vreco.general if you change the name of the file V.final.out or 
the grids information. It is self-explanatory any way.
